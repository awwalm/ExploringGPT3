# Exploring GPT-3
**_An unofficial first look at the general-purpose language processing API from OpenAI_**

A repo for practicing Steve Tingiris' Exploring GPT-3 book.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you may run the programs using **PyCharm** or an IDE/editor of your choice. As opposed to the book, I am not using Replit, this is all local.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: At the moment of writing, the source code was written with Python (3.8).
- **OpenAI API access**: You can save your API keys elsewhere that suits your security concerns - this codebase uses environment variables.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
